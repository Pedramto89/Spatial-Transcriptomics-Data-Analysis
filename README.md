# Navigating Spatial Transcriptomics: A Step-by-Step Guide with Visium 10XGenomics
## Introductory Concepts & Spatial Transcriptomics Background ##
Spatial transcriptomics is a cutting-edge technique that enhances traditional transcriptomics by adding a spatial dimension to gene expression analysis. Unlike conventional methods that can lose spatial context, spatial transcriptomics combines high-throughput RNA sequencing with histological imaging to map transcripts back to their original locations in a tissue sample. This is particularly useful in complex studies such as cancer research, where spatial organization of cells is crucial. Platforms like Visium 10X are commonly employed for this, offering high-resolution, genome-wide expression profiles. By leveraging this technique, researchers can gain unparalleled insights into tissue microenvironments, cell-cell interactions, and other aspects that necessitate a spatially resolved understanding of gene expression.

## Analytical Procedures: Detailed Steps for Analysis ##

In this process, the fundamental element of the analysis relies on the data format employed in the #SpatialExperiment (). Below, you can observe the data's structure, which will be utilized in different analyses. 
By using this class, we can store data at the point of analysis, such as data from sequencing platforms (e.g. 10x Genomics Visium) at the point of analysis.

#### 1- Load Data

Spatial transcriptomics data can be analyzed using multiple software packages available on the benchmark, including Seurat, Scanpy, and Giotto. In this workflow, instructions are based on the Seurat package in R. 
Initially, specifying the directory where the data resides is necessary for loading it via Seurat:

'''
slice <- "PDAC-9137-A"
root_dir <- "~/Documents/Visium/outs/" 
setwd(root_dir)

obj <- Load10X_Spatial(
  data.dir = root_dir,
  filename = "filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5",
  assay = "Spatial",
  slice = "slice1",
  filter.matrix = TRUE,
  to.upper = FALSE,
  image = NULL)

obj
'''
