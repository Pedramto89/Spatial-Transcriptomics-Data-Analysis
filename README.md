# Navigating Spatial Transcriptomics: A Step-by-Step Guide with Visium 10XGenomics
## Opening Remarks: Introductory Concepts & Spatial Transcriptomics Background ##
Spatial transcriptomics is a cutting-edge technique that enhances traditional transcriptomics by adding a spatial dimension to gene expression analysis. Unlike conventional methods that can lose spatial context, spatial transcriptomics combines high-throughput RNA sequencing with histological imaging to map transcripts back to their original locations in a tissue sample. This is particularly useful in complex studies such as cancer research, where spatial organization of cells is crucial. Platforms like Visium 10X are commonly employed for this, offering high-resolution, genome-wide expression profiles. By leveraging this technique, researchers can gain unparalleled insights into tissue microenvironments, cell-cell interactions, and other aspects that necessitate a spatially resolved understanding of gene expression.
